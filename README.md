# Mineral_Classification
Mineral Classification of Images with a Deep Learning Neural Network

# data/raw
This directory contains ~1000 different images of 7 different types of minerals (biotite, bornite, chrysocolla, malachite, muscovite, pyrite, and quartz).  These images were used to train a PyTorch neural network to identify mineral type based on a 3 channel RGB image.

# notebooks
This directory contains the notebook utilized to create the PyTorch model for image classification as well as an export of the model itself.

# requirements.txt
This project was created by utilizing an Anaconda environment.  This environment and dependencies can be recreated by utilizing the following line of code.<br>
$ conda create --name \<env_name> --file requirements.txt
